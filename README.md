# Opto-Box-v2
A versatile device for optogenetic manipulations in groups of flies 

## Description

The opto-box is a device for optogenetic activation or silencing in groups of adult fruit-flies. It has an Arduino at its heart which controls a number of WS2812B RGB LEDs. It uses off the shelf components and (almost) fully 3D printed. Ignoring the print times the device can be assembled over a weekend. It represents a significant improvement (not just in terms of looks) over an earlier iteration. The device can function as a standalone unit once the user inputs(colour of light, intensity, frequency, duration) have been input through the serial monitor.

## Introduction

Optogenetics is the use of light to control some aspect of biology in a living system. My previous project gives a short intro on how this tool is leveraged in Drosophila especially in the context of neuroscience research so I will not go into that here. The reason for building this device was that there were no commercial solutions to our problem. In the lab, we study the role of sleep in memory consolidation(among other things). Our memory assays use groups of flies and that means we have to perform optogenetic manipulations uniformly in as many as 100 flies per vial. To my knowledge there are no commercial systems that do this. This is where the Opto Box comes in. Here is the first iteration of it.
