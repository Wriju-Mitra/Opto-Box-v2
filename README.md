# Opto-Box-v2
A versatile device for optogenetic manipulations in groups of flies 

Description
The opto-box is a device for optogenetic activation or silencing in groups of adult fruit-flies. It has an Arduino at its heart which controls a number of WS2812B RGB LEDs. It uses off the shelf components and (almost) fully 3D printed. Ignoring the print times the device can be assembled over a weekend. It represents a significant improvement (not just in terms of looks) over an earlier iteration. The device can function as a standalone unit once the user inputs(colour of light, intensity, frequency, duration) have been input through the serial monitor.
